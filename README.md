# WordSearch
A simple word search program, made using Python, which finds where the words in the entered file are on the entered grid.

### How to run
- Open the WordSearch folder, and run the WordSearchProgram.
- Once the program is open, it will ask for a file name. In here you enter the grid text file. There is one in the WordSearch folder for you called grid, so enter grid.txt (You can use your own grid, however it has to be in the same format as grid.txt and has to be in the WordSearch folder).
- It will then ask for the file name of the file which contains the words to be searched. There is also one of these in the WordSearch folder for you called wordstofind, so enter wordstofind.txt (You can use your own words, however they have to be in the same format as wordstofind.txt and have to be in the WordSearch folder).
- The grid will then be presented to you, accompanied with a list of the words found and where they are, and a list of the words not found.
